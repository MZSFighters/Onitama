1. Recommended way of defining functions:

def hello_name(name: str) -> str:
    return(f"Hello {name}")

this is pretty close to java and helps prevent type confusion

2.method functions should always be directly under declaration

      def say_hello(name):
        """A simple function that says hello... Richie style"""
        print(f"Hello {name}, is it me you're looking for?")
    
3. For multiline comments always leave an empty line before the code 
 
 def says(self, sound=None):
        """Prints what the animals name is and what sound it makes.

        If the argument `sound` isn't passed in, the default Animal
        sound is used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sound : str, optional
            The sound the animal makes (default is None)

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If no sound is set for the animal or passed in as a
            parameter.
        """
        
        #Code starts here
